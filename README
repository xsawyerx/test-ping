NAME
    Test::Ping - Testing pings using Net::Ping

VERSION
    Version 0.16

SYNOPSIS
    This module helps test pings using Net::Ping

        use Test::More tests => 2;
        use Test::Ping;

        my $good_host = '127.0.0.1';
        my $bad_host  = '1.1.1.1;

        ping_ok(     $good_host, "able to ping $good_host" );
        ping_not_ok( $bad_host,  "can't ping $bad_host"    );
        ...

DESCRIPTION
    Using this module you do not have to work with an object, but can
    instead use actual procedural testing functions, which is cleaner and
    more straight forward for testing purposes. This module keeps track of
    the object for you, starting and closing it and provides a nifty way of
    testing for pings.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  ping_ok( $host, $test )
    Checks if a host replies to ping correctly.

    This returns the return value and duration, just like Net::Ping's ping()
    method.

  ping_not_ok( $host, $test )
    Does the exact opposite of ping_ok().

  create_ping_object_ok( @args, $test )
    This tries to create a ping object and reports a fail or success. The
    args that should be sent are whatever args used with Net::Ping.

  create_ping_object_not_ok( @args, $test )
    Tried to create a ping object and attempts to fail. The exactly opposite
    of the above test.

EXPORT
    ping_ok

    ping_not_ok

    create_ping_object_ok

    create_ping_object_not_ok

SUPPORTED VARIABLES
    Variables in Test::Ping are tied scalars. Some variables change the
    values in the object hash while others run methods. This follows the
    behavior of Net::Ping. Below you will find each support variable and
    what it changes.

  BIND
    Runs the 'bind' method.

  PROTO
    Changes the 'proto' hash value.

  TIMEOUT
    Changes the 'timeout' hash value.

  PORT
    Changes the 'port_num' hash value.

  HIRES
    Changes the package variable $hires.

  SOURCE_VERIFY
    Changes the package variable $source_verify.

  SERVICE_CHECK
    Changes the 'econnrefused' hash value.

INTERNAL METHODS
  _has_var_ok( $var_name, $var_value, $description )
    Gets a variable name to test, what to test against and the name of the
    test. Runs an actual test using Test::Builder.

    This is used to debug the actual module, if you wanna make sure it
    works.

        use Test::More tests => 1;
        use Test::Ping;

        # Test::Ping calls the protocol variable 'PROTO',
        # but Net::Ping calls it internally (in the hash) 'proto'
        # (this is documented above under PROTO)
        # this is checking against Net::Ping specifically

        $Test::Ping::PROTO = 'icmp';
        Test::Ping::_has_var_ok(
            'proto',
            'icmp',
            'Net::Ping has correct protocol variable',
        );

  _ping_object
    When debugging behavior, fetching an internal object from a procedural
    module can be a bit difficult (especially when it has base inheritance
    with another one).

    This method allows you (or me) to fetch the actual Net::Ping object from
    Test::Ping. It eases testing and assurance.

    This is used by the Tie functions to set the variables for the object
    for you.

        use Test::Ping;
        use Data::Dumper;

        print 'Object internals: ' . Dumper( Test::Ping->_ping_object() );

    Or you could also change the Net::Ping object to one of your own:

        use Test::Ping;
        use Net::Ping;

        Test::Ping->_ping_object( Net::Ping->new(@opts) );

    And doing it with tests:

        use Test::More tests => 2;
        use Test::Ping;

        create_ping_object_ok( 'tcp', 2, 'Creating our own Net::Ping object' );
        ping_ok( $target, "Yay! We can reach $target" );

    However, you should be warned. I test for a Net::Ping object so trying
    to pass other objects will fail. If anyone needs this changed or any
    reason, contact me and I'll consider it.

DEPENDENCIES
    This module uses Net::Ping, Tie::Scalar and Carp.

    Test::Timer is used in the test suite.
